                        <p>That’s 795 million people on the planet who suffer from chronic hunger, according to the United Nations World Food Program The U.N. forecasts that an additional 2 billion people will be lacking food by 2050

                    <h4>Shelter for a family</h4>
                    <p>Maintenance of family processes can protect parents, children, and families from the detrimental effects of extreme stressors, such as homelessness. When families cannot maintain routines and rituals, the stressors of poverty and homelessness can be compounded for both caregivers and children.

                    <h4>Education for a child</h4>
                    <p>The effects of poverty on children are wide-reaching and can lead to lifelong struggles, especially when young people don’t receive full educations.

                        Poverty and education are inextricably linked, because people living in poverty may stop going to school so they can work, which leaves them without literacy and numeracy skills they need to further their careers.
